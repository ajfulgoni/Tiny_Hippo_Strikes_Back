The below is the strategy if we decide to move. --

Running strategy:
Strategy per quadrant. This plan can be reused for each section if desired.

Starting point: top left corner

select variables:
	height of eraser/planetary gear system**
	+- error of distributed force reading
	needed force of the eraser
	number of discrete rows (ie, length of quardent = discrete rows + remainder)

The following can be repeated in a function and reused for each row (assumes eraser has been raised and is off the board):
	even out robot and apply the eraser (repeatable function)
	* this must be done for each row because as the robot moves vertically, the angle the rope makes with board and the robot will change, tiling the robot.
		aquire all force readings of feet
		determine average and store that value
			the average of the force values of all 4 feet will be the force evenly distributed
		rotating through each foot, move the foot in/out until the force reading matches the average, +- the accepted error
		extend the eraser, monitoring the force until it equals the desired force +- the accepted error
			it is safe now to extend the eraser because the robot is even with the board and the eraser will be applied parralel to the board

	move towards the right boundry while spinning the planetary gear
		if autonomous, until limit switch, located on the end of the robot, is activiated
	
	when at the end
		stop the gear from spinning
		raise the system

	lower the robot by the length of the eraser system
	move all the way to the left edge
		if autonomous, until limit switch, located on the end of the robot, is activiated

for the row == the number of discrete rows-1 (where rows are numbered 0-x):
	*there must be a limit switch on the end of the robot, regardless of autonomy
	if the limit switch is engadged, do nothing
		this means that the height of the quadrent is a multiple of the eraser height
	otherwise, lower the robot until it engadges +- accepted error
	repeat above
		the erased area will overlap part of the area erased on the previous run, but in order to get as much of the board as possible this row is necesary
